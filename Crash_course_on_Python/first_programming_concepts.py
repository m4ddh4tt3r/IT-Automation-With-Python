""" Functions """

""" A function is a piece of code that performs a unit of work.
In the examples you've seen so far, you have only encountered the print() function,
which outputs a message to the screen.
You will use this function frequently in this course to check the results of your code.
The syntax of the print() function is modeled in the example below. """

# Syntax for printing a string of text. Click Run to check the result.

print("Hello world!")


""" Keywords """

""" A keyword is a reserved word in a programming language that performs a specific purpose.
In your first Python example, you briefly encountered the keywords for and in.
Note that keywords will often appear in bold in this course. 

In the next few weeks, you will also learn the following keywords:

Values: True, False, None
Conditions: if, elif, else
Logical operators: and, or, not
Loops: for, in, while, break, continue
Functions: def, return  

You don't need to learn this whole list now. We'll dive into each keyword as we encounter them.
There are additional reserved keywords in Python. If you would like to read about them,
please visit the linked “Python Keywords” article in the Resources section at the end of this study guide. """

""" Arithmetic Operators """

""" Python can calculate numbers using common mathematical operators, along with some special operators, too:  

x + y            Addition + operator returns the sum of x plus y
x - y             Subtraction - operator returns the difference of x minus y
x * y            Multiplication * operator returns the product of x times y
x / y             Division / operator returns the quotient of x divided by y
x**e            Exponent ** operator returns the result of raising x to the power of e 
x**2            Square expression returns x squared
x**3            Cube expression returns x cubed
x**(1/2)    Square root (½) or (0.5) fractional exponent operator returns the square root of x
x // y           Floor division operator returns the integer part of the integer division of x by y
x % y          Modulo operator returns the remainder part of the integer division of x by y

Order of operations
The order of operations are to be calculated from left to right in the following order: 

Parentheses ( ), { }, [ ]

Exponents xe   (x**e)

Multiplication * and Division /  

Addition + and Subtraction -    

 You might find the PEMDAS mnemonic device to be helpful in remembering the order."""
