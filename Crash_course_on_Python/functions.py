""" Knowledge """
""" The purpose of the def() keyword is to define a new function. 

Best practices for writing code that is readable and reusable:
    Create a reusable function - Replace duplicate code with one reusable
        function to make the code easier to read and repurpose.

    Refactor code - Update code so that it is self-documenting and the intent of the code is clear.
    
    Add comments - Adding comments is part of creating self-documenting code.
        Using comments allows you to leave notes to yourself and/or
        other programmers to make the purpose of the code clear."""

# Use a function that accepts multiple parameters
# Return a result value

# This function calculates the number of days in a variable number of
# years, months, and days. These variables are provided by the user and
# are passed to the function through the function’s parameters.
def find_total_days(years, months, days):
    # Assign a variable to hold the calculations for the number of days in
    # a year (years*365) plus the number of days in a month (months*30) plus
    # the number of days provided through the "days" parameter variable.
    my_days = (years * 365) + (months * 30) + days
    # Use the "return" keyword to send the result of the "my_days"
    # calculation to the function call.

# Call the conversion from within the print() function using 2 fluid
# ounces. Convert the return value from a float to a string.
